## Description
This script automates the download of *Solo Leveling* chapters (1-270) using web scraping. It leverages multi-threading for faster processing and saves each chapter as a separate `.txt` file in a dedicated `chapters` directory. The script also cleans the content by removing ads, JavaScript messages, and sponsor notes.

---

## Features
- **Multi-threaded scraping** for faster chapter retrieval.
- **Automatic text cleaning** to remove unwanted content (ads, scripts, sponsor messages).
- **Chapter organization** into individual text files.
- **Progress tracking** with runtime statistics.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries
